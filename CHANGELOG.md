Quick fix on Activity Bar name. It was still being called GitHub Repository Loader (early name) instead of Manager.

Fixed private repositories not showing as private.

Added "Created" and "Updated" dates on repository tooltip.

## 0.2.7 - May 12, 2020

## 0.2.1 ~ 0.2.6 - May 11, 2020

Quick README fixes.

Logo updated again. I looked at my screen while I was a little slid in the chair and I got this idea of the gradient. "Blue gradient. Nice. Now let's add pink or purple." and I kept moving two linear gradients and changing its colors until it looked nice on both of my monitors. lol


## 0.2.0 - May 11, 2020

Fixed Cloned Repositories Search not working with some remotes.

Changed project logo.

Improved README.

- Added usage .gif (that took my time to get it "ok"!)

Added error message if the extension can't open the OAuth callback server.

Changed REST requests to Graphql. Reduces network usage, reduces time to retrieve the data and also now shows the "Fork of" information when hovering a repository.


## 0.1.1 - May 6, 2020
