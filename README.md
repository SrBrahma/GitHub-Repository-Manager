**[1.0.0]** We are now using the VS Code integrated GitHub login system!

<h2><b> Log out </b></h2>

To logout in this new VS Code system, remove it from the Trusted Extensions. In the next VS Code session, the extension won't have access to your account. Note that if

<h2><b> Cloned Repositories Search </b></h2>

To make your GitHub cloned repositories show up in the **Cloned** tree view, you will need to set the **`"git.defaultCloneDirectory"`** on your VSCode `settings.json` file to an absolute path where your cloned repositories are located (may be deep). On Linux you may use **"\~"** to point to your home directory. On Windows, you must use the `"X:\\folderA\\folderB"` pattern.

I store my repos under **"\~/Dev"**, so that's what I use as my **"git.defaultCloneDirectory"** value.


<h2><b> Creating a repository </b></h2>

While hovering the **REPOSITORIES** tree view title, a plus (**+**) button appears. Click on it, and enter the new repository name, description (optional) and visibility. On success, you may choose to clone the new repository.

<h2><b> Creating a repository for current project </b></h2>

![](images/readme/publish.png)

You may create a GitHub repository and push your current project within the same flow. If there are multiple folders in your workspace that may be published to GitHub, it will be prompted to pick the desired one.

There are 2 possible cases that allows using that publish functionality:

1) **Your project doesn't have a Git yet.** After entering the repository name, description and visibility, the repository will be created, the git will be initialized for the workspace folder, `main` branch will be created and selected, GitHub remote will be added as `origin` and your files will then be pushed to it.

2) **Your project has a Git, but it hasn't a remote yet.** After filling the repository information, it will be checked if your git HEAD is `master`. If so, it will ask if you want the branch to be renamed to `main`. Yes or no, the repository will be created, the GitHub remote is added as `origin` and your code is pushed.

![](images/readme/config/coloredIconsTrue.png) ![](images/readme/config/coloredIconsFalse.png)

_Those `*` means that the repository is **dirty**! It means that it has local changes that weren't yet commited! Please, report errors with it! I will soon add an option to individually Delete non-dirty repositories!_


- ## Default Clone Directory Maximum Depth
##### _"githubRepositoryManager.clonedRepositoriesSearch.defaultCloneDirectoryMaximumDepth"_
How deep on `"git.defaultCloneDirectory"` the cloned repositories will be searched. A depth of 0 means it will only search in the directory itself, a depth of 3 means it will search up to 3 directories below.
##### Default: **3**


- ## Directories To Ignore
##### _"githubRepositoryManager.clonedRepositoriesSearch.directoriesToIgnore"_
Directories names that our cloned repositories searcher will ignore.

      Changelog
  </a>
</h1>

<h1 align="center"> Roadmap </h1>

- Search and clone public repositories

- Only show Repository creation icon when logged

- Git not installed message

- Other repositories found by the Cloned Repository Searcher. Useful for quickly opening a repository you don't own.

- Visualize without cloning (useful for getting some value or checking something from some repository)

- "Order by" (alphabetically, stars, your open frequency, created on, updated on) in top menu

- Search repository by name

- Fetch repositories on demand - Some devs have hundreds or thousands of repos. Instead of fetching all of them on init and displaying all of them together, there could be a \[1..100\], \[101, 200\] tree system, for both on demand fetch and display.

- Remove cloned from local if it isn't dirty (= not locally diff from github)
